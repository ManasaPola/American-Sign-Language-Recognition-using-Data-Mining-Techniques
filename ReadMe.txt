American Sign Language Recognition using Data Mining Techniques
•	Developed a computing system to identify sign language gestures taking time series into consideration. Data was captured using accelerometer, Gyroscopes, EMG sensors and video recordings. Derived features using Discrete Wavelet Transform, Fast Fourier Transform and Statistical methods. Feature selection is done using PCA and LDA techniques.
•	Classifies gestures using Decision trees, Support Vector Machines and Artificial neural Networks. 
•	Implemented a similar binary classifier to classify each actions.
